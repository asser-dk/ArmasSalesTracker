# Armas Sales Tracker
Source code for the Armas sales tracker scraper for the game APB


How to:  


1. You will need a Postmark (http://postmarkapp.com) account for the subscription service to work. (the first 25.000 emails you send are free)  
2. You will need two users for the armas market place (http://www.gamersfirst.com/marketplace/ingame/?gameID=20) one with premiun and one without premium. Enter their credentials in the app config file (Copy or rename the Template.config)  
3. (Optional) You will need an Azure (azure.com) account in order to publish the WebJob but you can run the ArmasSalesTracker project directly if you don't need it to run scheduled.  


*Yes, I know there is a postmark server token in the git history - and yes - I have disabled said token :)*
